Server Pi: Turn your Raspberry Pi into a all-purpose server!
=================

This repo will guide you through a set-up procedure that turns your _Raspberry Pi_ device (_Raspian_ needed) into a full-time, all-purpose server capable of:

* web server: using _nginx_ + _PHP_ + _SQLite_. Hope you won't mind.
* file share: using _Samba_.
* remote download: using _Aria2_ with _yaaw_ GUI.
* SSH login with zsh support: using _oh-my-zsh_.
* remote desktop control: using _x11vnc_.   
   If you don't mind losing all your windows via HDMI cable when connecting via VNC, try _tightvncserver_.
* real-time file sync: using _Bittorrent Sync_.
* calendar and contact sync: using _OwnCloud_.
* Time Machine (disabled by default): using _Netatalk 3_.

This project is still a pre-alpha experimental toy. Though these stuff are designed for novices to Linux and/or Raspberry Pi, I highly suggest that you be prepared to meet with thousands of exceptions. I would really appreciate that if you are willing to tell my how you think of anything related or just reports a (or billions of) bugs! Contact me at <tslimingyang@126.com>.
